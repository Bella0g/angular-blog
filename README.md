## TODOS:

* ~~Create a navbar for both user and owner perspectives. The navbar should contain a button to switch between perspectives.~~

### User perspective:
* ~~Create at least three pages: home, blog, and about me.~~

* ~~Home page should contain all blog posts. Each post should have a title and a thumbnail image.~~

* Clicking on a post should take the user to a new page that shows the post in detail. Blog page should contain the post that the user clicked on from the home page. 

* Users should be able to add new comments anonymously and like/dislike the post. The page should have a button/link to navigate back to the home page.

* ~~About me page should contain information about the user and a form to contact them.~~
* ~~The form should print all information to the console when submitted.~~

### Owner perspective: 
* ~~Include everything from the user perspective~~
* ~~Add a new page to create new posts.~~
* ~~All posts should have a structure that includes a title, thumbnail image, content, creation date, likes, dislikes, and comments.~~
* ~~Save the posts in localStorage to prevent data loss when reloading the app.~~

### Buggs
* Bild syns ej är till lagd i post list, måste fixas!
* post details info ska laddas in dynamsiskt.
